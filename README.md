# Pepper Covid Info

This is a simple example of a minimally interactive Covid-19 info application.

Pepper will:

 * Alternate between a few simple informative messages
 * If someone comes too close, Pepper will give a warning on maintaining safety distances
 * If someone touches the tablet Pepper will give a warning on touching objects and washing hands.

The project contains two applications:

 * One application in French, "Pepper Gestes Barri√®re", using the text and visuals of [the French Government's official recommendations](https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus).
 * A more generic one in English, "Pepper Covid Info", using [visuals by Laura Reen on Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/coronavirus-information).
